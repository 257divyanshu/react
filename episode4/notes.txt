PROPS
- props to a component are like arguments to a function
- arguments to components are passed as key value pairs : key="value" without any commas 
- all these arguments (key="value" pairs) are wrapped inside the props object   
- to access the argument value we need to use props.keyname

CONFIG DRIVEN UI
- user interfrace driven by data (configs)

KEYS
- keys help react to identify similar elements (like elements belonging to same parent or list elements of unordered/ordered list) uniquely
- react wants to identify the elements uniquely so that it can make decision which element to render and which element to not
- if it can uniquely identify elements, then it will render new and updated elements
- if it can't then it will re-render those elements again and again (this is redundant re-rendering)
- indices shouldn't be used as keys
- not giving keys makes a huge performance hit
