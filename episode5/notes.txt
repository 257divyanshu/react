everything we are doing with react can also be done using HTML, CSS and JavaScript 

restructuring our codebase
- convention 1 : code to be kept in src folder 
- convention 2 : components to be stored inside a component folder (which will be kept inside the src folder)
- convention 3 : the name of the component file and the name of the functional component should be same (should begin with a capital letter)
- convention 4 : hardcoded data shouldn't be kept in component folder, mockdata should be placed in a mockdata.js file in the utils folder, and constants like URL parts should be stored in a constants.jsfile in the utils folder 
- convention 5 : the contents of the constants.js (which are to be exported) to be named will all caps
- we an also have .jsx extension instead of .js extension

default export
- export default Name;

named export
- export const Name1 = "something";
- export const Name2 = "somethingAgain";

default import
- import Name from "";

named import
- import {Name1, Name2} from "";

we can also have a default export with named exports in a single file

updating a simple variable won't update the UI, for this to happen we need to have a state variable

building a button that filters out the top rated restaurants
- we made a filter button put it inside the body tag 
- then we attached an onClick event to it
- the onClick function filters the array of restaurants
- but the UI didn't change
- we want our UI to change when the configs change

We need to keep our UI layer and data layer in sync
- this is what all the frameworks and libraries are trying to do

Now, our resList is a normal variable
- we can make resList a super powerful variables
- we will make resList a state variable
- for creating this state variable we need to use a react hook called useState

Hooks
- is basically a normal javascript function
- hooks are like utility functions 
- hooks too were written by facebook developer
- two important react hooks
- useState and useEffect

useState hook
- is used to create a superpowerful react variable or a state variable
- we need to import this hook from react (named import)
- React is default exported from react
- other things (like hooks) are named exported from react

syntax for using useState hook
- const [resList,setResList] = useState(restaurants);
- resList is the name of the state variable
- setResList is the name of the function that will be used to change the state variable
- we cannot change a state variables without using the special function that the useState function returns us
- the argument inside the useState function is the default value for the state variable
- the useState function returns us an array (which we have destructured)
- there is no other way to update a state varialbe (other than using the speical function)
- convention is use the setStateVariableName
- whenever a state variable updates react re-renders the component

Reconcilliation Algorithm
- also known as react fiber
- a virtual DOM is created 
- when changes are made in the file, a new virtual DOM is created
- then minimum difference between the two virtual DOM is calculated using the diiffing algorithm
- then these minimum differences are made into the DOM
- this reduces the amount of DOM manipulation that needs to done

Virtual DOM object
- the logged reactelement object is the virtual dom object

ReactFiber came in react 16

Why react is fast?
- because react does DOM manipulations efficienntly (using virtual DOM)
