about useEffect() hook
- if we don't give any dependency array, the useEffect() hook will be called every time our components renders
- if we provide an empty dependency array, the useEffect() hook is called only on initial render
- if we put something inside the dependency array, then the useEffect() hook will be called only when one or more dependency changes

about useState() hook
- used for creating local state variables inside functional components
- always call useState() hook on the top of the functional components
- never use useState() hook inside conditionals, loops or nested function (this may lead to inconsistencies)

routing
- we will be installing react-router-dom
- we will first make an about page
- before creating routes we need to make a routing configuration in the root script of our project
- for createing a routing configuration we need to use the createBrowserRouter() function
- this function takes an array as argument
- this array argument is an array of object 
- this object contain two things, one path and one element
- inside the path we will specify the path
- inside the element we will specify the component we want to render
- now we have created our routing configuration
- but just creating a browser configuration won't work
- we need to render this configuration into our page 
- for this we need to use the routerProvider 
- earlier we were just rendering our AppLayout component
- but now we need to render our routing configuration
- synatx for rendering a router configuration is : rootElement.render(<routerProvider router={RouterConfigName}/>)
- there are many types of router (in react-router-dom)
- but we should use createBrowserRouter for basic purposes
