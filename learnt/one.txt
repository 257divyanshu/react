- needs three properties : text-ellipsis overflow-hidden whitespace-nowrap

object fit property
- fill: this is the default value which stretches the image to fit the content box, regardless of its aspect-ratio.
- contain: increases or decreases the size of the image to fill the box whilst preserving its aspect-ratio.
- cover: the image will fill the height and width of its box, once again maintaining its aspect ratio but often cropping the image in the process.
- none: image will ignore the height and width of the parent and retain its original size.
- scale-down: the image will compare the difference between none and contain in order to find the smallest concrete object size.
